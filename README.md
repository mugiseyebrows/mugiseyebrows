I'm software developer, my main passion is GUI desktop applications. I know Qt and C++ wery well and have been using it for decade now. I also like python, javascript (for simplicity, modularity, coroutines with async await) and c# (for same reasons plus linq) and familiar with web technologies: css, html, express, react, nodejs, parcel, webpack. I use git, linux, ansible, docker and cicd pipelines. I'm interested in neural networks, language parsers, signal processing, electronics and automation as well.

My values are freedom and humanity. I'm cisgender man, my pronoun is "he".

Hope you're doing well and would like to hear from you and collaborate on commercial or community software.
